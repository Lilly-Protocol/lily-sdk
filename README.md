TypeScript-first SDK for integrating Lily Protocol's autonomous agent finance infrastructure into Node.js applications.

The SDK is designed for backend and service-to-service integrations that need typed access to AgentLily wallets, agent identity, autonomous payments, and Lily backend APIs on Stellar.

## Status

This repository is production-oriented foundation work. The public API, tooling, and contributor workflow are in place, while several domain methods still use intentionally conservative request models so the SDK can evolve alongside the backend without breaking contributors every week.

## Features

- Typed SDK constructor with strict configuration validation
- Modular clients for agents, wallets, payments, identity, and system health
- Reusable HTTP transport abstraction with auth header handling, timeouts, and retry scaffolding
- ESM and CommonJS builds with emitted declaration files
- Vitest test suite, ESLint, Prettier, and GitHub Actions CI
- Contributor-ready project docs, issue templates, and example script

## Installation

```bash
npm install @lily-protocol/sdk
```

For local development in this repository:

```bash
npm install
```

## Requirements and Compatibility

- **Node.js 20 or newer** is required. CI verifies the SDK on Node.js 20 and 22.
- The default transport requires the standard Fetch API globals, including `fetch`,
  `Headers`, and `AbortController`. Supported Node.js versions provide these globals.
- In another JavaScript runtime without a global `fetch`, pass a Fetch API-compatible
  implementation through `config.fetch`:

  ```ts
  import { LilySdk } from '@lily-protocol/sdk';

  const sdk = new LilySdk({
    baseUrl: 'https://api.lilyprotocol.com',
    fetch: customFetch,
  });
  ```

  If neither a global nor configured `fetch` is available, SDK construction throws a
  `LilyConfigError` with guidance to provide one. A custom implementation must return
  Fetch API-compatible `Response` objects, including `Headers`.

### Browser usage

The SDK can use browser Fetch APIs, but it is primarily intended for backend and
service-to-service integrations. Before using it in a browser:

- Configure the Lily API to allow the browser origin, HTTP methods, and request headers
  through CORS. Requests may otherwise fail before reaching the API.
- Do not include long-lived API keys or auth tokens in a public browser bundle. Route
  privileged calls through a trusted backend instead.
- Confirm that the target browser provides `fetch`, `Headers`, and `AbortController`, or
  supply compatible polyfills for the environment.

## Quick Start

```ts
import { LilySdk } from '@lily-protocol/sdk';

const sdk = new LilySdk({
  baseUrl: 'https://api.lilyprotocol.com',
  authToken: process.env.LILY_AUTH_TOKEN,
  apiKey: process.env.LILY_API_KEY,
});

const health = await sdk.system.health();
const wallet = await sdk.wallets.provision({
  agentId: 'agent_123',
  network: 'stellar-testnet',
});

console.log(health.status);
console.log(wallet.wallet.address);
```

## Public API Overview

```ts
import { LilySdk } from '@lily-protocol/sdk';

const sdk = new LilySdk({ baseUrl: 'https://api.lilyprotocol.com' });

sdk.agents.list();
sdk.wallets.provision({ agentId: 'agent_123', network: 'stellar-testnet' });
sdk.payments.quote({
  fromWalletId: 'wallet_123',
  toAddress: 'GB...',
  amount: { assetCode: 'USDC', amount: '10.00' },
});
sdk.identity.resolve({ agentId: 'agent_123' });
sdk.system.health();
```

## Design Notes

- `LilySdk` composes a shared transport with focused domain clients instead of exposing a single massive client surface.
- Models are exported from stable entrypoints so future internal refactors do not require a public breaking change.
- The HTTP layer is intentionally small and swappable, which keeps backend integration work easy to test and contributor-friendly.

## Roadmap Themes

- Real backend endpoint alignment and response model hardening
- Pagination helpers and richer idempotency ergonomics
- Webhook verification, observability hooks, and advanced auth flows
- More complete Stellar asset and payment orchestration coverage
